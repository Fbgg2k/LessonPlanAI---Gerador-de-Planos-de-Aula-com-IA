## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#3498DB) to evoke feelings of trust, intelligence, and focus. It provides a calm and professional backdrop suitable for educational content.
- Background color: Light blue (#E7F5FE), very desaturated hue of the primary color provides a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Green (#2ECC71), is analogous to the primary color; this provides a contrasting and optimistic call to action.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif will give a fashionable, high-end, and elegant look.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', this humanist sans-serif pairs well with Playfair, and will provide warmth and readability.

- A clean, organized layout will enhance readability and make navigation easy.
- Subtle animations can be used to provide feedback and guide the user through the process.
